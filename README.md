# Get started
- Create a "folts" folder within the same folder of the jupyter notebook.
- Add any static fonts to the folder (e.g. NotoSans-Medium.ttf)
- In the notebook, define the lists of fonts, colors, sizes and strings that will be exported
- Run all cells, an "assets" folder will be created including sub-folders for each font. All exported assets will be available there.

Used to create assets to be imported in ZEPP Watchface Maker --> https://docs.zepp.com/docs/guides/tools/watchface/
